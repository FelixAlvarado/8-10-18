What is the time complexity of buble sort? what are the steps for this algorithm? 

time: O(n^2) 

1. Go through the array 
2. if the next element is smaller (or larger depending on you're doing ascending/descending), with switch the elements.
3. If any elements were switched during the run through, run through the arrray gain 
4. repeat the runthroughs until no switches have been made. 

Describe when it may be ideal to utilize bubble sort 

When trying to find the largest k elements of an array, you would use bubble sort, but only make k times. At the end, the last k items of the arrya are the k largest numbers. 
time complexity: O(nk)

what is vertical scaling? 

scaling by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine. 

What is horizontal scaling? 

Scaling by adding more machines.
